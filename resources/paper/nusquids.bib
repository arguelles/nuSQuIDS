@article{Saviano:2014bs,
	Abstract = {Short-baseline neutrino anomalies suggest the existence of low-mass ( m \sim O(1)~eV) sterile neutrinos \nu_s. These would be efficiently produced in the early universe by oscillations with active neutrino species, leading to a thermal population of the sterile states seemingly incompatible with cosmological observations. In order to relieve this tension it has been recently speculated that new "secret" interactions among sterile neutrinos, mediated by a massive gauge boson X (with M_X << M_W), can inhibit or suppress the sterile neutrino thermalization, due to the production of a large matter potential term. We note however, that they also generate strong collisional terms in the sterile neutrino sector that induce an efficient sterile neutrino production after a resonance in matter is encountered, increasing their contribution to the number of relativistic particle species N_ eff. Moreover, for values of the parameters of the \nu_s-\nu_s interaction for which the resonance takes place at temperature T\lesssim few MeV, significant distortions are produced in the electron (anti)neutrino spectra, altering the abundance of light element in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using the present determination of $^4$He and deuterium primordial abundances we determine the BBN constraints on the model parameters. We find that $^2$H/H density ratio exclude much of the parameter space if one assume a baryon density at the best fit value of Planck experiment, \Omega_B h^2= 0.02207, while bounds become weaker for a higher \Omega_B h^2=0.02261, the 95 % C.L. upper bound of Planck. Due to the large error on its experimental determination, the helium mass fraction Y_p gives no significant bounds.},

	Abstract = {A search for muon anti-neutrino to electron anti-neutrino oscillations was conducted by the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center using muon anti-neutrinos from positive muon decay at rest. A total excess of 87.9 +/- 22.4 +/- 6.0 events consistent with electron anti-neutrino plus proton scattering to positron plus neutron was observed above the expected background. This excess corresponds to an oscillation probability of (0.264 +/- 0.067 +/- 0.045), which is consistent with an earlier analysis. In conjunction with other known limits on neutrino oscillations, the LSND data suggest that neutrino oscillations occur in the 0.2-10 eV^2/c^4 Delta-m^2 range, indicating a neutrino mass greater than 0.4 eV/c^2.},

@article{Pospelov:2011dp,
	Abstract = {New neutrino states \nu_b, sterile under the Standard Model interactions, can be coupled to baryons via the isoscalar vector currents that are much stronger than the Standard Model weak interactions. If some fraction of solar neutrinos oscillate into \nu_b on their way to Earth, the coherently enhanced elastic \nu_b-nucleus scattering can generate a strong signal in the dark matter detectors. For the interaction strength a few hundred times stronger than the weak force, the elastic \nu_b-nucleus scattering via new baryonic currents may account for the existing anomalies in the direct detection dark matter experiments at low recoil. We point out that for solar neutrino energies the baryon-current-induced inelastic scattering is suppressed, so that the possible enhancement of new force is not in conflict with signals at dedicated neutrino detectors. We check this explicitly by calculating the \nu_b-induced deuteron breakup, and the excitation of 4.4 MeV \gamma-line in ^{12}C. Stronger-than-weak force coupled to baryonic current implies the existence of new abelian gauge group U(1)_B with a relatively light gauge boson.},

	Abstract = {We show that sterile neutrinos with masses ~1 eV or larger, as motivated by several short-baseline oscillation anomalies, can be consistent with cosmological constraints if they are charged under a hidden sector force mediated by a light boson. In this case, sterile neutrinos experience a large thermal potential that suppresses mixing between active and sterile neutrinos in the early Universe, even if vacuum mixing angles are large. Thus, the abundance of sterile neutrinos in the Universe remains very small, and their impact on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, and large-scale structure formation is negligible. It is conceivable that the new gauge force also couples to dark matter, possibly ameliorating some of the small-scale structure problems associated with cold dark matter.},

	Abstract = {The recent discovery of B-modes in the polarization pattern of the Cosmic Microwave Background by the BICEP2 experiment has important implications for neutrino physics. We revisit cosmological bounds on light sterile neutrinos and show that they are compatible with all current cosmological data provided that the mass is relatively low. Using CMB data, including BICEP-2, we find an upper bound of $m_s < 0.85$ eV ($2\sigma$ Confidence Level). This bound is strengthened to 0.48 eV when HST measurements of $H_0$ are included. However, the inclusion of SZ cluster data from the Planck mission and weak gravitational measurements from the CFHTLenS project favours a non-zero sterile neutrino mass of $0.44^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$ eV. Short baseline neutrino oscillations, on the other hand, indicate a new mass state around 1.2 eV. This mass is highly incompatible with cosmological data if the sterile neutrino is fully thermalised ($\Delta \chi^2>10$). However, if the sterile neutrino only partly thermalises it can be compatible with all current data, both cosmological and terrestrial.},

	Abstract = {The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab reports results from an analysis of the combined $\nu_e$ and $\bar \nu_e$ appearance data from $6.46 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target in neutrino mode and $11.27 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target in antineutrino mode. A total excess of $240.3 \pm 34.5 \pm 52.6$ events ($3.8 \sigma$) is observed from combining the two data sets in the energy range $200<E_\nu^{QE}<1250$ MeV. In a combined fit for CP-conserving $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\rightarrow\bar{\nu}_e$ oscillations via a two-neutrino model, the background-only fit has a $\chi^2$-probability of 0.03% relative to the best oscillation fit. The data are consistent with neutrino oscillations in the $0.01 < \Delta m^2 < 1.0$ eV$^2$ range and with the evidence for antineutrino oscillations from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND).},

	Abstract = {Recently new reactor antineutrino spectra have been provided for 235U, 239Pu, 241Pu and 238U, increasing the mean flux by about 3 percent. To good approximation, this reevaluation applies to all reactor neutrino experiments. The synthesis of published experiments at reactor-detector distances <100 m leads to a ratio of observed event rate to predicted rate of 0.976(0.024). With our new flux evaluation, this ratio shifts to 0.943(0.023), leading to a deviation from unity at 98.6% C.L. which we call the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The compatibility of our results with the existence of a fourth non-standard neutrino state driving neutrino oscillations at short distances is discussed. The combined analysis of reactor data, gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments, and MiniBooNE-neutrino data disfavors the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8% C.L. The oscillation parameters are such that |Delta m_{new}^2|>1.5 eV^2 (95%) and sin^2(2\theta_{new})=0.14(0.08) (95%). Constraints on the theta13 neutrino mixing angle are revised.},

@article{Kopp:2014nosterile,
	Abstract = {Sterile neutrino models with new gauge interactions in the sterile sector are phenomenologically interesting since they can lead to novel effects in neutrino oscillation experiments, in cosmology and in dark matter detectors, possibly even explaining some of the observed anomalies in these experiments. Here, we use data from neutrino oscillation experiments, in particular from MiniBooNE, MINOS and solar neutrino experiments, to constrain such models. We focus in particular on the case where the sterile sector gauge boson $A'$ couples also to Standard Model particles (for instance to the baryon number current) and thus induces a large Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein potential. For eV-scale sterile neutrinos, we obtain strong constraints especially from MINOS, which restricts the strength of the new interaction to be less than $\sim 10$ times that of the Standard Model weak interaction unless active-sterile neutrino mixing is very small ($\sin^2 \theta_{24} \lesssim 10^{-3}$). This rules out gauge forces large enough to affect short baseline experiments like MiniBooNE and it imposes nontrivial constraints on signals from sterile neutrino scattering in dark matter experiments.},

@article{Mohapatra:qv,
	Abstract = {During 2004, four divisions of the American Physical Society commissioned a study of neutrino physics to take stock of where the field is at the moment and where it is going in the near and far future. Several working groups looked at various aspects of this vast field. The summary was published as a main report entitled ``The Neutrino Matrix'' accompanied by short 50 page versions of the report of each working group. Theoretical research in this field has been quite extensive and touches many areas and the short 50 page report provided only a brief summary and overview of few of the important points. The theory discussion group felt that it may be of value to the community to publish the entire study as a white paper and the result is the current article. After a brief overview of the present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing and some popular ways to probe the new physics implied by recent data, the white paper summarizes what can be learned about physics beyond the Standard Model from the various proposed neutrino experiments. It also comments on the impact of the experiments on our understanding of the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe and the basic nature of neutrino interactions as well as the existence of possible additional neutrinos. Extensive references to original literature are provided.},

@article{Halzen:kq,
	Abstract = {A high-energy neutrino telescope, such as the operating AMANDA detector, may detect neutrinos produced in sources, possibly active galactic nuclei or gamma-ray bursts, distant by a thousand megaparsecs. These sources produce mostly nu_e or nu_mu neutrinos. Above 1 PeV, nu_e and nu_mu are absorbed by charged-current interactions in the Earth before reaching the opposite surface. However, the Earth never becomes opaque to nu_tau since the tau^- produced in a charged-current nu_tau interaction decays back into nu_tau before losing significant energy. This preferential penetration of tau neutrinos through the Earth above 10^14 eV provides an experimental signature for neutrino oscillations. The appearance of a nu_tau component would be evident as a flat zenith angle dependence of a source intensity at the highest neutrino energies. Such an angular dependence would indicate nu_tau mixing with a sensitivity to delta-m^2 as low as 10^-17 eV^2, for the farthest sources. In addition, the presence of tau neutrino mixing would provide the opportunity for neutrino astronomy well beyond the PeV cutoff, possibly out to the energies matching those of the highest energy protons observed above 10^20 eV.},

abstract = {In the core of the Sun, energy is released through sequences of nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium. The primary reaction is thought to be the fusion of two protons with the emission of a low-energy neutrino. These so-called pp neutrinos constitute nearly the entirety of the solar neutrino flux, vastly outnumbering those emitted in the reactions that follow. Although solar neutrinos from secondary processes have been observed, proving the nuclear origin of the Sun/'s energy and contributing to the discovery of neutrino oscillations, those from proton-proton fusion have hitherto eluded direct detection. Here we report spectral observations of pp neutrinos, demonstrating that about 99 per cent of the power of the Sun, 3.84 [times] 1033 ergs per second, is generated by the proton-proton fusion process.},

We present the appropriate formalism for computing the combined effect of oscillations, absorptions, nu_tau-regeneration. Total rates are modified by an O(0.1--10) factor, comparable to astrophysical uncertainties, that instead negligibly affect the spectra. We then calculate different signal topologies in neutrino telescopes: through-going muons, contained muons, showers, and study their capabilities to discriminate a dark matter signal from backgrounds. We finally discuss how measuring the neutrino spectra can allow to reconstruct the fundamental properties of the dark matter: its mass and its annihilation branching ratios.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews the results of the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments. The primary goal of each experiment was to effect sensitive searches for neutrino oscillations in the mass region with $\Delta m^2 \sim 1$ eV$^2$. The two experiments are complementary, and so the comparison of results can bring additional information with respect to models with sterile neutrinos. Both experiments obtained evidence for $\bar \nu_\mu \rightarrow \bar \nu_e$ oscillations, and MiniBooNE also observed a $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ excess. In this paper, we review the design, analysis, and results from these experiments. We then consider the results within the global context of sterile neutrino oscillation models. The final data sets require a more extended model than the simple single sterile neutrino model imagined at the time that LSND drew to a close and MiniBooNE began. We show that there are apparent incompatibilities between data sets in models with two sterile neutrinos. However, these incompatibilities may be explained with variations within the systematic error. Overall, models with two (or three) sterile neutrinos seem to succeed in fitting the global data, and they make interesting predictions for future experiments.},

The resulting equations are straightforward extensions of the classical transport equations that nevertheless contain the full physics of quantum oscillation phenomena. In this way, our broadened formalism provides a bridge between the familiar neutrino transport algorithms employed by supernova modelers and the more quantum-heavy approaches frequently employed to illuminate the various neutrino oscillation effects. We also provide the corresponding angular-moment versions of this generalized equation set. Our goal is to make it easier for astrophysicists to address oscillation phenomena in a language with which they are familiar. The equations we derive are simple and practical, and are intended to facilitate progress concerning oscillation phenomena in the context of core-collapse supernova theory.},

@article{Strack:qd,
	Abstract = {In the standard approaches to neutrino transport in the simulation of core-collapse supernovae, one will often start from the classical Boltzmann equation for the neutrino's spatial, temporal, and spectral evolution. For each neutrino species, and its anti-particle, the classical density in phase space, or the associated specific intensity, will be calculated as a function of time. The neutrino radiation is coupled to matter by source and sink terms on the "right-hand-side" of the transport equation and together with the equations of hydrodynamics this set of coupled partial differential equations for classical densities describes, in principle, the evolution of core collapse and explosion. However, with the possibility of neutrino oscillations between species, a purely quantum-physical effect, how to generalize this set of Boltzmann equations for classical quantities to reflect oscillation physics has not been clear. To date, the formalisms developed have retained the character of quantum operator physics involving complex quantities and have not been suitable for easy incorporation into standard supernova codes. In this paper, we derive generalized Boltzmann equations for quasi-classical, real-valued phase-space densities that retain all the standard oscillation phenomenology, including resonant flavor conversion (the MSW effect), neutrino self-interactions, and the interplay between decohering matter coupling and flavor oscillations. With this formalism, any code(s) that can now handle the solution of the classical Boltzmann or transport equation can easily be generalized to include neutrino oscillations in a quantum-physically consistent fashion.},

We use each of these scenarios to illustrate key facets of collective neutrino oscillations.

Unfortunately, the existence of beams with sufficient luminosity for the task has been ruled out by the AMANDA South Pole neutrino telescope. In this Letter we point out that, with the advent of second-generation kilometer-scale neutrino detectors, the idea of studying the internal structure of Earth may be revived using atmospheric neutrinos instead.},
