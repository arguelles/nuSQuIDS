A user manual can be generated by: make docs;

Prerequisites
*************

The following packages are required to build and use the client library, and
can probably be had from your favorite package manager:

* gsl (>= 1.15): http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
* hdf5 with c bindings: http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
* C++ compiler with C++11 support
* SQUIDS (>= 1.2): https://github.com/jsalvado/SQuIDS/

PythonToolBox
*************

Additionally for compiling and using the python bindings:

-Required:
* boost (>= 1.54): http://www.boost.org/
* numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
* matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/

-Recommended:
* ipython: http://ipython.org/

Modified the make file and compaile the directory
found in

nuSQUIDS/resources/python/src/

after successful compilation the bindings will be stored in

nuSQUIDS/resources/python/bindings/

Finally, modify your system PYTHONPATH:

export PYTHONPATH=$(PATH_TO_nuSQUIDS)/resources/python/bindings/:$PYTHONPATH

Documentation
*************

The latex and pdf files are included in nuSQuIDS/doc/ folder.

Configuration
*************

The path for the GSL libraries can be specified by running:

./config.sh --with-gsl-incdir=GSL_include_path --with-gsl-libdir-=GSL_library_path

The path for the HDF5 libraries can be specified by running:

./config.sh --with-hdf5-incdir=HDF5_include_path --with-hdf5-libdir=HDF5_library_path

Finally, the path for SQuIDS can be specified by:

./config.sh --with-squids-incdir=SQuIDS_include_path --with-squids-libdir=SQuIDS_library_path
